# Data Quality Co-pilot Requirements

## High-Level Goals
- Build a prototype data-quality inspection tool that automates the process of analyzing datasets
- Provide both console and web interfaces for data quality assessment
- Implement a multi-agent architecture for robust data processing
- Integrate LLM capabilities for intelligent schema discovery and validation

## Success Criteria
- Successfully load and analyze CSV/Excel files
- Auto-generate comprehensive data schemas using LLM
- Perform quality checks and generate detailed reports
- Provide real-time feedback through web interface
- Demonstrate MCP integration for agent communication

## Core Features

### 1. Data Ingestion
- Support for CSV and Excel file formats
- Error handling for missing files and malformed data
- Data normalization and preprocessing

### 2. Automated Schema Discovery
- LLM-powered schema generation
- Column type inference and constraint identification
- Schema validation against actual data

### 3. Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Ingestion Agent**: File reading and data normalization
- **Schema Agent**: LLM interaction and schema generation
- **Validation Agent**: Quality rule application and validation
- **Reporting Agent**: Report generation and output formatting

### 4. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration
- Chunked prompt/context management
- Tool call injection capabilities
- Intermediate thought collection
- Structured agent communication

### 5. Web Dashboard
- File upload interface
- Real-time processing visualization
- Interactive data quality dashboards
- Schema and validation result display

### 6. Console Interface
- Command-line demo application
- End-to-end pipeline demonstration
- Sample data processing workflow

## Technical Requirements
- Python-based implementation with Flask/FastAPI for web interface
- Pandas for data manipulation
- OpenAI GPT integration for LLM capabilities
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- RESTful API design for web interface
